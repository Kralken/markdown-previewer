Emphasize text with \*! Wrap text in 1 for *italics* and 2 for **bold**.

Backticks (\`) will let you show code inline `const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));` <- like this!

Use three of them (\`\`\`) to enclose a whole block like below

<React.StrictMode>
    <App />
</React.StrictMode>
```

> like this!
